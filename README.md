# DSC180A-GroupNull: Misinformation Detection System

# DO NOT MAKE IT PUBLIC
- API Keys were in the commit history.
  
## Project Overview

A hybrid misinformation detection framework that combines:
- Predictive ML models (stance, sentiment, sensationalism, reputation, topic, intent)
- Agent-based reasoning using Gemini (Chain-of-Thought & Fractal CoT)
- Optional web-grounded verification
- Streamlit interface for interactive testing

The system extracts structured credibility signals from an article and integrates them into a multi-step reasoning pipeline for final credibility analysis.

### Setup Steps

1. **Log into DSMLP and launch the required GPU environment**
All model training, evaluation, and experiments should be run inside the following DSMLP container:
```
launch-scipy-ml.sh -W DSC180A_FA25_A00 -c 8 -m 32 -g 1
```
   
2. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YulinChen12/DSC180A-GroupNull.git
cd DSC180A-GroupNull
```

3. **Create Environment**
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate dsc180
```
OR

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Ensure Git LFS is installed and pull large files**
```
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

**IMPORTANT: Some Model Artifacts Are NOT Included**

Large trained model files are NOT uploaded due to GitHub size limits. You must generate them locally.

Generate Predictive Model Artifacts
From the repo root, run:
```
python -m pred_models_training.train_all
```

### Dataset Overview
This project uses multiple datasets for different components of the pipeline. Below is a clear explanation of each key file found inside the ```pred_data/``` folder

- ```pl_train.csv```, ```pl_val.csv```, ```pl_test.csv```
  
  These files come from the LIAR-PLUS stance dataset, where each sentence is labeled with:
  - support
  - neutral
  - deny
  
  These labels are used exclusively for training our stance prediction model located in:```pred_model_training/stance_model/```
  
  The stance model learns to classify how a sentence relates to a claim (agree, neutral, or disagree).
 
- ```train2.tsv```, ```test2.tsv```, ```val2.tsv```
  - These files are used for training and evaluating the predictive components (e.g., sensationalism, sentiment, coverage, reputation).

- ```train_article.json```, ```test_article.json```, ```test_article_no_label.json```
  - This dataset contains full news articles with labels that we use to train and evaluate the generative agent.

  
## 1. Running Predictive Pipeline Only
After training, you can place a news article into this file to test: 
```
python pred_article.py
```
It will output the following:
```
=== Predictions ===
factor           label         conf
--------------------------------------
news_coverage    ...
intent           ...
sensationalism   ...
sentiment        ...
reputation       ...
stance           ...

```

## 2.Agent Framework
Make sure you have a AI Studio API key to run the agents!

Set them in the py files:
```
os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] =YOUR_KEY
```
This project includes two reasoning agents:

### 1. CoT Agent (```cot_agent.py```)
- Standard Chain-of-Thought reasoning
- Can be exposed on a shared IP
- Designed for live API-style usage
  
To run:
```
python agents/cot_agent.py
```

Then test using:
```
python client.py
```

All machines using the same IP can call this agent once it's running.

### 2. FCoT Agent (```fcot_agent.py```)
- Fractal Chain-of-Thought reasoning
- Multi-agent architecture
- Parallel factor analysts
-  Context-grounded verification
  
To run:
```
python agents/fcot_agent.py
```

Then test using:
```
python client.py
```

All machines using the same IP can call this agent once it's running.


### 3. Running the Streamlit App
The Streamlit web interface is located in ```streamlit_app/app.py```

Start Using Provided Script in your terminal
```
./start_streamlit.sh
```

This launches a live UI where users can paste article text to 
- Visualize stance, sentiment, sensationalism, reputation, news coverage predictions
- Get additional feature labels: title vs body alignment, context veracity, location
- Run the agentic Gemini-based credibility analysis
